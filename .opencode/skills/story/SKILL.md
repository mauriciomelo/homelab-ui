Create a story file following the structure and style of the provided examples.
The file should be created in markdown format with the filename `0000-story-name.md` inside the `docs/stories` directory.

---

## Context

<todo>
White here a brief description of the context or background for the story. Make sure to cover the reasoning behind the story. This should be a short paragraph.
</todo>

## Acceptance Criteria

<todo>
Write clear, concise, and testable acceptance criteria focused on user outcomes (the "what"), not implementation details (the "how").
Group or split criteria as needed so each item can be verified independently (with an automated test ideally).
Avoid technical steps, internal APIs, or file references in the ACs.
You do not need to add testing tasks to the Task List, since it's implied that all tasks should include tests (unless it's not applicable). Add testing notes in the Tech Notes section instead.
</todo>

<example>
- [ ] **Task 1 title**: Description of the first task or acceptance criteria.
- [ ] **Task 2 title**: Description of the second task or acceptance criteria.
</example>

## Tech Notes

<todo>
Here you can include any technical notes, implementation details, or references that will help in completing each task above. This could include links to relevant documentation, code snippets, or explanations of complex concepts.
If there are similar components or patterns in the codebase, mention them here for reference with file.
</todo>

<example>
### Task 1 title
- This should be similar to component X found in `path/to/componentX.tsx`.
- Use `useFieldArray` from `react-hook-form` to manage the dynamic list of fields.
</example>
